  <summary>A set of Cambodian fonts</summary>
  <description>
    <p>
	The Khmer OS fonts include Khmer and Latin alphabets, and they have equivalent
	sizes for Khmer and English alphabets, so that when texts mix both it is not
	necessary to have different point sizes for the text in each language.
	They were created by Danh Hong of the Cambodian Open Institute.
